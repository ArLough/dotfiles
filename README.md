# About

Dotfiles repo to track a few of my configurations, work in progress

## Quick start

1. [Add ssh key to github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?tool=cli)
2. Clone repo
3. run `chmod +x install.sh ./install.sh`

## Points of interest
 - macos/brew-cask.sh contains my mac apps I use
 - macos/macos_defaults contains my defaults I like when setting up a new mac
 - zsh/.zshrc contains my zsh configs and oh-my-zsh plugins

## Future Plans
 - Switch to Iterm and backup in configs here
 - Backup vscode configs and extensions
 - Use mackup
