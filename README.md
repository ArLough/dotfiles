# About

Dotfiles repo to track a few of my configurations, work in progress


## Points of interest
 - macos/brew-cask.sh contains my mac apps I use
 - macos/macos_defaults contains my defaults I like when setting up a new mac
 - zsh/.zshrc contains my zsh configs and oh-my-zsh plugins

## Future Plans
 - Switch to Iterm and backup in configs here
 - Backup vscode configs and extensions
 - Use mackup
